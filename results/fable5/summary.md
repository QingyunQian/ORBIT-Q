Runtime is the evaluator's timed `run_solution(config)` wall time from the
cloud precheck (4 vCPU x86_64); the official stamp records its own runtime in
`challenge-NN/reward.json`.

Task 04 was first stamped before commit cd60dd3 synced the scorer with
the declared runtime-free reward policy (that stamp showed 0.8646 = runtime
interpolation x otherwise perfect components); the recorded reward.json is
from the re-stamp with the synced scorer and reads 1.0.


`T/T_ref` is the hardware-independent artifact-efficiency metric used by the
paper figures: candidate runtime divided by the publication reference runtime,
both measured on the same machine and image (details and provenance in
`challenge-NN/runtime-comparison.json`). Lower is better; 1.0 matches the
expert TensorCircuit-NG reference. The canonical environment pins
`tensorcircuit-nightly 1.8.0.dev20260726`, which integrates the `omeco`
contractor, so all official references (including task 01) run unmodified;
earlier measurements on the 2026-06-18 nightly are kept under `history` in
each JSON. To avoid hinting, each reference is executed only after the
corresponding candidate solution is frozen, and reference source files are
never read by the solver.

Challenge-01 physics summary (cloud precheck): DMRG reference -41.50400741,
initial variational energy identical to reference (diff 1.6e-13), final energy
within 1.3e-6 of reference after the fixed 500-step Adam refinement; all five
evaluator criteria PASS.

Challenge-03 physics summary (cloud precheck): exact sparse GS energy density
-1.17548478; cooling drives the energy density from -0.4443 to -1.0259 (gap
0.15 to exact GS, criterion allows 1.0); loss decreased -0.4408 -> -1.0225;
final total post-selection success probability 1.56e-2 with the required
exp(60 * mean_log_p) consistency; the reference implementation converges to
nearly identical final metrics, confirming protocol alignment.

Challenge-04 physics summary (cloud precheck): the asymmetric bit-flip
channel is expressed as an explicit (3, 2, 2) Kraus stack contracted into the
one-qubit superoperator sum_a K_a (x) K_a^*, and the 12-qubit density matrix
is simulated in vectorized form on tc.MPSCircuit (24 sites: ket copy on site
2q, bra copy on site 2q+1; native gates for probe preparation and RXX,
proj_with_mps overlaps for observable traces). Numerically identical (3e-15)
to the v1 Kraus-ladder network, which was validated against brute-force
density-matrix evolution but rejected by the LLM audit as a raw-simulator
bypass. Fitted probabilities p01=0.034033, p10=0.011037 (absolute errors
3.3e-5 and 3.7e-5, tolerance 2e-4); table MSE 7.1e-3 -> 2.5e-8; fitted Kraus
set trace-preserving to 1e-16.

Challenge-05 physics summary (cloud precheck): exact sparse GS energy density
-1.326896 (18 qubits, h=1.10); the ten-layer non-unitary filter cascade
(exp(a_l X) on all qubits then exp(b_l ZZ) on brickwork bonds, state rescaled
to unit norm after every layer, gate-level composition on disjoint supports)
cools the energy density from -1.1720 to -1.32673, within 1.7e-4 of the exact
ground state (criterion allows 0.5) and never below it; learned filter
strengths grow monotonically toward the late layers.

Challenge-12 physics summary (cloud precheck): the two-layer SU4 brickwork
circuit (each gate the matrix exponential of the 15 su(4) Pauli generators)
is simulated exactly on the framework MPS simulator (bond <= 8), and the
loss is the direct tensor-network overlap with the evaluator's quimb
DMRG-MPS target loaded as framework MPS site tensors (never converted to a
preparation circuit). Official evaluator: fidelity 1.9e-9 -> 0.8699
(threshold 0.85) over exactly 5000 Adam updates; the near-zero initial
overlap is intrinsic (the staggered field pins the target on the Neel
pattern opposite to the prescribed |0101...> start).

Challenge-11 physics summary (cloud precheck): native spin-1 simulation on
the framework's QuditCircuit (dim=3, 12 sites); rotations use closed spin-1
exponentials, bond gates are matrix exponentials of the task's 9x9 generator
including the fixed beta (S.S)^2 biquadratic term. Energy density optimized
from -0.0595 to -0.7048 (gap 0.069 to the exact ground state, criterion
0.12), and the optimized state reproduces the Haldane string order:
[-0.403, -0.354, -0.399] vs exact [-0.303, -0.318, -0.344], MAE 0.064
(criterion 0.12). First task where the candidate artifact runs faster than
the publication reference (T/T_ref = 0.74).

Challenge-10 physics summary (cloud precheck): the fixed 18-qubit
controlled-Z hyperedge is expressed through the framework's multicontrol
gate in MPO form (17 controls + Z target; no dense 2^18 matrix, no gate
decomposition), rotations are RX-RZ-RY blocks composed at the 2x2 gate
level, and the TFIM energy is evaluated against a bond-3 MPO (matrix-vector
style contraction). Energy density optimized from +0.9346 to -1.2141, gap
0.078 to the exact Lanczos reference (criterion allows 0.25). The candidate
runs 372s (over the 300s budget; runtime is reported, not reward-gating) vs
the 20.6s expert reference - the largest artifact-efficiency gap in this run
(T/T_ref = 18.06).

Challenge-09 physics summary (cloud precheck): the two local Pauli terms of
the 512-qubit random ladder circuit depend only on finite backward causal
cones (18 and 15 qubits, matching the evaluator's pauli_cone_sizes; 74 and 80
gates out of 3897), extracted classically from the gate tape and simulated as
small TensorCircuit-NG circuits; the cone parameter sets are disjoint so
coordinatewise Adam on the full 3897-parameter vector decouples exactly. All
200 vmapped restarts converge to the analytic maximum 1.56459 = 0.56459 + 1.0
(success fraction 1.0, final variance ~0).

Challenge-08 physics summary (cloud precheck): 8192 computational-basis
samples drawn directly from the 49-qubit shallow 2D circuit tensor network
(Circuit.sample with allow_state=False, omeco contraction paths; no 2^49
statevector or dense probability vector). Cross-checked against exact
lightcone contractions: max single-site Z error 0.012 (tol 0.03), probe
Z-string max 0.011 / mean 0.005 (tol 0.05 / 0.015); the official hidden-set
evaluator confirms with functional PASS.

Challenge-07 physics summary (cloud precheck): trajectory-averaged
measurement-feedback VQE over 64 fixed-uniform trajectories (projective
mid-circuit ancilla measurements via the framework's jittable cond_measure,
measurement-conditioned RZZ feedback); the averaged data-TFIM energy improves
from -6.490 to -10.034 (improvement 3.54, criterion 0.3; target -8.3;
8-qubit exact GS is about -10.15), and the optimizer converges to a nearly
measurement-insensitive protocol (final per-trajectory energy std 3e-4).

Challenge-06 physics summary (cloud precheck): exact sparse GS energy density
-1.602552 (14 qubits); the four digital-analog hybrid blocks (continuous-time
Schrodinger evolution of the trainable analog Hamiltonian via the framework's
ODE integrator honoring ode_rtol/ode_atol/ode_max_steps, followed by RZ-RY-RZ
digital layers) optimize the energy density from -0.4840 to -1.2589 (gap 0.34
to exact GS, criterion allows 1.0); learned analog times, couplings and
detunings all inside their prescribed bounds.

Challenge-02 physics summary (cloud precheck): exact sparse GS energy density
-2.00036788; energy density optimized from -0.7412 to -1.9925 (gap 0.0079 to
exact GS, criterion allows 1.0); loss decreased -0.6538 -> -1.9683; final
block entropies [0.305, 0.594, 0.261] vs targets [0.30, 0.60, 0.80] (MSE
0.0968) - the third checkpoint stays low because the energy term dominates
the 0.25-weighted entropy penalty near the ground state, which is the honest
optimum of the prescribed loss; all evaluator criteria PASS.
